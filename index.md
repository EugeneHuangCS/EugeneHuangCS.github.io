excerpt: "About Me"
---
I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang University in 2016. During my undergraduate study, I worked in the [Digital Media Computing & Design Lab](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} under [Siliang Tang](http://person.zju.edu.cn/en/siliang){:target="_blank"}. I contributed to the ZJU Entity Discovery and Linking System and won the first place in the NIST 2016 Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population Contest.

After graduate, I joined [Qunhe Information Technology](http://www.kujiale.com/){:target="_blank"} as a research engineer. I have created an automated floor plan recognition system, and currently working on 3D scenes style transfer. My research interests focus on machine learning, especially on reinforcement learning and transfer learning.

### Current Interests and Projects:

- Image Super Resolution with Seperate Albedo and Shading Space
- Automated Floor Plan Recognition.
- Floor Plan Evaluation.
- Automated Sample Room Matching.
- Automated Lighting.
- 3D Scences Style Transfer.
