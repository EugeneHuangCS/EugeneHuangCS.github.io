excerpt: "About Me"
---
I am a Ph.D. student at University of Southern California (since Fall 2019), working with Prof. [Fred Morstatter](https://isi.edu/~fredmors/) and Prof. [Aram Galstyan](https://www.isi.edu/people/galstyan/about). My research interest is natural language processing, graph neural network, and embedding learning in general.

I have an internship at Adobe in summer 2020, working with [Xue Bai](https://sites.google.com/view/xuebai/home) and [Aseem Agarwala](http://www.agarwala.org/).

<!--- 
I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang University in 2016. During my undergraduate study, I worked in the [Digital Media Computing & Design Lab](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} under [Siliang Tang](http://person.zju.edu.cn/en/siliang){:target="_blank"}. I contributed to the ZJU Entity Discovery and Linking System and won the first place in the NIST 2016 Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population Contest.

After graduate, I joined [Qunhe Information Technology](http://www.kujiale.com/){:target="_blank"} as a research engineer. I have created an automated floor plan recognition system, and currently working on 3D scenes style transfer. My research interests focus on machine learning, especially on reinforcement learning and transfer learning.
