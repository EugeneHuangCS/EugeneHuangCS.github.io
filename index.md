I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang University in 2016. During my undergraduate study, I worked in the Digital Media Computing & Design Lab under Siliang Tang. I contributed to the ZJU Entity Discovery and Linking System and won first place in the NIST 2016 Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population Contest.

After graduate, I joined Qunhe Information Technology as a research engineer. I have created an automated floor plan recognition system, and currently working on 3D scenes style transfer. My research interests focus on machine learning, especially on reinforcement learning and transfer learning.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Automated Floor Plan Recognition System.
- Floor plan evaluation system.
- Automated Sample Room Matching System.
- Automated Lighting System.
- 3D Scences Style Transfer.
